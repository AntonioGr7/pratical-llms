This currency debasement resulted in rampant inflation, disrupting the stability of the economy. Additionally, the Roman Empire heavily depended on slave labor. This caused unemployment among free citizens because maintaining slaves was cheaper than hiring free citizens. The decline in employment opportunities resulted in economic instability. On top of these, the empire\\'s expansion towards the east made them reliant on imports, like grain from Egypt.

To start with, one of the significant pieces of evidence is the devaluation of Roman currency. As highlighted by Harper (2016), the empire suffered from severe inflation due to the constant debasement of their currency, making it difficult for the economy to remain stable. Moreover, the overreliance on slave labor also played a detrimental role. As pointed out by Scheidel (2007), the dependence on slaves led to unemployment among free Roman citizens. This is because slaves were significantly cheaper to maintain compared to hiring free citizens, leading to a decline in job opportunities, which in turn resulted in economic instability. Furthermore, the empire\\'s expansion to the east made them highly dependent on imports, for instance, grain from Egypt. As noted by Temin (2006), this created a trade deficit that further weakened the Roman economy. When the empire began to lose its territories, it became increasingly difficult to maintain this trade imbalance, leading to economic decline. In conclusion, it can be argued that the economic troubles, mainly due to the devaluation of currency and overreliance on slave labor, were significant contributing factors to the fall of the Roman Empire. The evidence provided, which includes scholarly references to Harper (2016), Scheidel (2007), and Temin (2006), supports this thesis.\\n\\n###Score Rubrics:\\nIs the answer well supported with evidence, including citations/attributions wherever relevant?\\n\\n###Feedback: '"
