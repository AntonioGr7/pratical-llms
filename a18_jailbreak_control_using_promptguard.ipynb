    "\n",
    "LLM powered appications are target of prompt attack, which are prompts intentionally designed to change the intendend behavior of the application. \n",
    "Categories of prompt attacks include prompt injection and jailbreaking:\n",
    "- Prompt Injections are inputs that exploit the concatenation of untrusted data from third parties and users into the context window of a model to cause the model to execute unintended instructions.\n",
    "- Jailbreaks are malicious instructions designed to override the safety and security features built into a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "PromptGuard is a really small and efficient classifier trained by Meta on an extreme large corpus of attacks. The model is able to detect explicitly malicious prompt as well prompts that contain injected inputs (Prompt Injections)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is opensource and freely available on Huggingface (https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Prompt-Guard-86M). \n",
    "\n",
    "LLamaGuard 3 on the other hand extende the capabilities already seen in Llama Guard 2 adding three new categories: Defamation, Elections and Code Interpreter Abuse. Having a level of content safety is essential because the alignment process alone is not enough to ensure unauthorized use of our applications.\n",
